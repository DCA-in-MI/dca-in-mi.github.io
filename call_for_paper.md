## Call for Papers

We invite submissions on papers related to Data Curation and Augmentation in Medical Imaging (see [Scope](#scope)). All accepted papers will be presented in the poster session during the workshop (see [poster info](call_for_paper.html#poster-information) and [program](program.html)). Some papers have additionally been selected for [oral presentations](papers.html).

Papers should be submitted to one of three tracks:

- **Track 1 (archival): Original work**:
  - Original research papers that have not been published previously at any other peer-reviewed venue.
  - Accepted papers will be published in the CVPRW proceedings.
  - Track-1 submissions must be anonymous and papers will be reviewed in accordance with the **double-blind** reviewing policy. Submitted papers must be 3-8 pages in the [CVPR format](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) excluding references. Additional supplementary material can be submitted as well.
  - Submission link: [Track 1](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2024/Workshop/DCAMI_archival)

- **Track 2 (non-archival): Original/preliminary Work**:
  - Original research that has not been published previously at any other peer-reviewed venue. This is intended for work in progress, preliminary results, or other research that is best suited for a workshop setting.

## FAQs
- My paper was accepted at DCAMI, which registration type for CVPR should I choose?
  - If your paper was accepted to **Track 1 (archival)**, then an **"AUTHOR/FULL PASSPORT REGISTRATION" is required** for at least one of the authors of your paper, in order for it to appear in the CVPR-Workshop proceedings. The "ONE DAY WORKSHOP/TUTORIAL PASS" is **not** sufficient. For more infos see [CVPR's pricing](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/Pricing2).
  - If your paper was accepted to **Track 2 or 3 (non-archival)**, then any registration which covers the workshops is sufficient ("full" or "workshop only"). [CVPR's rule](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/Pricing2) that workshop paper require a full registration only holds for _archival_ workshop papers.
- Where can I get an invitation letter (e.g. for visa applications)?
  - After registering to CVPR, you can simply download your invitation letter [here](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/accounts/login?next=/InvitationLetter).
- My paper was accepted for Track 1. Where and when should I submit my camera-ready version?
  - For Track 1 accepted authors, instructions to archive the camera-ready paper are provided in the following links: ([Submission instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVRbiNL5l_WiHhmWCeK2g6cD5ZfqpSkW/view?usp=share_link) and [Submission site](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kBZZ2gLQPO3oS5qs9R0_A8fTuWHNGwx/view?usp=share_link)). The deadline for submission and copyright transfer is **April 14**. Mark the date!
- The camera-ready instructions state that every paper needs at least one author registered at CVPR. Does registration have to be done before the camera-ready deadline on April 14?
  - No, you can still register after April 14.
- Does every author have to have an OpenReview account?
  - Our submission policy differs from [CVPR's](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) in that we do **not** require all co-authors to have a OpenReview account.
- On the camera-ready paper submission site, what should I enter for the paper ID field?
  - The format of paper ID should be "DCAMI_[Your paper ID]". For example, "DCAMI_24". For our intents and purposes, the workshop ID equates the workshop acronym. We apologize for the ambiguous instructions on the submission site, and will continue working with the CVPR chairs for clarification.
- Will accepted papers be published in the CVPR-Workshop proceedings?
  - Only papers accepted to Track 1 will be published in the CVPR-Workshop proceedings.
- Will rejected submissions from Track 1 (archival, proceedings) still be considered for acceptance at Track 2 (non-archival, preliminary work)?
  - Yes! If a submission is rejected from Track 1 but reviews indicate that it is still valuable for Track 2 (e.g. the idea is promising but evlaution is insufficient for Track 1), authors might be offered to present their work as an accepted paper at Track 2.
