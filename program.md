    <h3>Cecilia Lee</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Lee is a Professor of Ophthalmology and the Klorfine Family Endowed Chair in the Department of Ophthalmology at University of Washington. Dr. Lee is a clinical epidemiologist and medical retina/uveitis specialist and co-leads Computational Ophthalmology Lab which focuses on machine learning/big data research in transdisciplinary fields such as ophthalmic imaging, neuroradiology, and neuropathology. Her research interests include “Big Data” research involving electronic medical records and non-invasive imaging datasets in retina. She is passionate about investigating the relationship between the aging eyes and the aging brains to better understand the neurodegenerative pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer’s disease.
